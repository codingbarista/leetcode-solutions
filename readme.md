# Coding Barista's Readable Javascript Solutions

This repo is dedicated to my viewers who are actively working through leetcode to land their dream job!
I will update this repo every time I upload corresponding video on my Youtube channel.
In a interview setting, one should be able to write a clean code with good style and should be able to explain their approach in a detailed manner. This repo will help anyone who are looking to crush their coding interview in javascript!

Disclaimer: my solutions aren't fastest solutions. Sometimes they will be and sometimes not. However, my solutions will be easy to read and easy to understand.
